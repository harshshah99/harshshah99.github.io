Hello there!

I am a final year undergraduate student at BITS Pilani pursuing a dual degree in MSc. Economics and B.E. Electrical and Electronics Engineering. I am interested in Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, Information Retrieval and Recommender Systems.


I was a Summer Research Intern at Philips Innovation Campus where I applied Machine Learning based methods to solve problems in the HealthTech domain. Currently, I am pursuing my undergraduate thesis at National University of Singapore under the guidance of [Dr. Kokil Jaidka](https://profile.nus.edu.sg/fass/cnmkj/).
